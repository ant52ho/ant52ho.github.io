Poop channel will be topic based

on frontend, users will be auto subscribed. This makes it so that changes
from the other user may be viewed




as in 
/poop/:user:/:command:

users include:
- anthony
- clare

commands include:
- increment
- decrement
- get

onIncrement and onDecrement: 
edit in-mem db associated with user

behind the scenes: 
- update main db 1x every 4hrs


how will it work? 
client app is directly subscribed. don't need to go through rest api system. 
client and server need lots of handlers. 

 main client 
 subscribe to other user
 query other user data, own data
 onIncrement: publishes to channel, which updates to inmem db and 
    messages all subscriber

[join rooms]
